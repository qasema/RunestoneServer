        <h1>Access Denied</h1>
        <p>
            Sorry, you have arrived at this page because you are lacking an important access token that is needed to access your course and/or save your work.</p>
        <p> This is probably not a serious problem.  You token may have timed out, or it may just be time to login again.  But if this happens
            repeatedly then it could be a sign of something more serious.
            <ol>
            <li>If you have blocked cookies from Runestone Academy then that is the problem.  Please enable cookies for this site.</li>
            <li>It may be that your school has filters that are causing the token to time out every time your computer sleeps or restarts.</li>
            <li>Your school may have software that resets browser settings every day.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it may simply be a case of you needing to log in again.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            please click the button <a href="/runestone/default/user/logout" class="btn btn-primary">Log Out</a> to log out.  Then log back in again.
        </p>
