    <h3>Check the FAQ</h3>
    <p>
        Sorry you are having trouble. I want to hear about problems you are having but
        before you create a bug report please
        <a href="https://blog.runestone.academy/pages/faq.html">Check our FAQ</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Get help from the Community</h3>
    <p>
        If you have a question that isn't answered in the FAQ there are a number of
        places to get help from the Runestone Community. Each of our books has a great
        community of teachers who are willing to help new people get started.

    on YouTube. In the summer of 2020 we did a 4 day virtual workshop for 200+
    instructors. I can almost guarantee that one of these videos will answer your
    questions about running a class on Runestone.

    <h3>File a Report on GitHub</h3>
    <p>
        OK, You don't have a question and are still running into some problem. Its time
        to create an issue on our
        <a href="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneServer/issues"
            >Github Issue Tracker</a
        >
        I regret that I am no longer able to respond to problems sent to me in email.
        Runestone has just grown too big for that. Filing issues on Github creates a
        public record that others can learn from and help with. Your own problem may
        already be on Github, if so, you can add more evidence to the record that will
        help me (or someone else) get to the bottom of the problem more quickly.

    <h3>Filing an effective Bug Report</h3>

    <p>
        Telling me that X does not work doesn’t really help. The truth is
        runestone.academy gets over 300,000 page views a day from people around the
        world. So most of the time when someone says “X does not work” it does in fact
        work fine for most people. This does not make it your fault, it just means I need
        more information to try to make sense of what is going on. Here are a few tips
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            What <strong>Task</strong> are you trying to accomplish? Understanding your
            goals is really important as sometimes its not obvious how to do something on
            Runestone
        </li>
        <li>
            What steps did you take to try to accomplish that task? Walking me through
            the steps gives me valuable context and saves me TONS of time in trying to
            recreate what went wrong.
        </li>
        <li>
            Specifically what went wrong? What error message did you see? What exactly
            did happen that you think should not have happened. You can speculate about
            what you think is broken, but often you will be wrong and misleading. Just
            the facts is a great policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Give some context about your environment. What course are you in? What is
            your username? What page of the course? Specifically what exercise does not
            work? Each activity has a unique identifier. please include that. What
            browser are you using? What version of the browser. (Runestone relies on many
            modern features of Javascript that are only present in new-ish browsers) We
            can not test every browser so if you are using something outside of Chrome,
            Firefox, Safari, or maybe Edge it is likely that I have not tested it there.
        </li>
        <li>
            If there is a traceback on this page, please copy it and include it in your
            <a href="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneServer/issues"
                >Github Issue</a
            >.
        </li>
        <li>
            Many many errors can be quickly diagnosed from the Javascript Console error
            log. On Chrome this is
            <code>View --> Developer --> Javascript Console</code>, on Safari ⌥⌘i or
            <code>Develop --> Show Web Inspector</code> on Firefox
            <code>Tools --> Web Developer --> Toggle Tools</code>
        </li>
    </ul>

        Please note, I'm not trying to be rude, but years of observation have taught me
        that CS teachers are pretty bad bug reporters! Imagine if a student sent you the
        following email:
    </p>
    <div style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
        <pre>
    Hey,
    
    You know problem 2 for the homework next week.  
    My program just doesn't work.  I'm pretty sure 
    I've done everything right.  Can you tell me how 
    to fix it?
    
    Thanks,
    
    Student
</pre
        >
    </div>
    <p>
        You wouldn't be able to help this student very much, in fact you probably
        wouldn't have any idea what program that student was even asking about without
        spending your own valuable time figuring it out. Sadly, It is a pretty good
        representation of thousands of bug reports I've received. So please, take a few
        seconds and read or re-read Filing an effective bug report. Thanks.
